ok, so this is another text called the
it is a speech and it is a group of text called
in order for you to have forgiveness within you
in order for you to be called by us [tonight], hm?
as your heart permits you, hm?
where we sat
where we stood, hm?
you were our hands
you were our feet
you were.
you went [carried out]
any task
any work we ordered, hm?
sometimes we scolded you
sometimes we spoke kindly
sometimes we spoke wrongly
sometimes
just god was
The one who was patient with us
The one who gave us strength
The one who gave us wisdom
that one/this way
We went, we traveled, hm?
On behalf of the mountains
We did not go [carry out this task]
For our own selfish reasons
For our own wishes
it was because
The mountains put us here
The community put us here, hm?
that is why we spoke
that is why we were [authorities]
that is why we were [authorities]
that is why we dwelled
to care for
All there is
that belongs to the mountains
that belongs to the community
that belongs to the mountains
that belongs to the community
that belongs, hm? And
in the same way came our
our fathers and mothers (our ancestors)
The ones who were contributors
The ones who have been community, hm?
The ones who have been community, hm?
and things should be the same in the future, hm?
may that not be lost and
may that not be changed
For all time as long as
The mountains are here
The community is here, hm?
as your heart permits [you], hm?
you commanded
other guards
other younger people
others, hm?
you, hm?
you gave them tasks
you sent them on missions
they went
they traveled, hm? And
now, hm?
We thank god for having
completed our year
For having completed our moon [month]
completed our star [day], hm?
We only need to be released from our obligations
We only need to leave
with our contribution (here)
with our community, hm? And
An issue
We still want to express to you
We still want to express to you
We still want to convey to you, hm?
our wish that
you show your best behavior
you show your best manners,
The best, hm?
Let us leave in a dignified way
Let us leave in the best way, hm?
may god help us
when we are released from our obligations
when we have finished our term
then, we will remembered
our work at home
So that we continue to exist,
So that we continue to survive,
because
while we sat, resided [presided]
sometimes we weren't able
sometimes our work [harvest] got spoiled
sometimes
yes indeed, and that is why we call on you [tonight], hm?
So that [you]
Do not cease to counsel
Do not cease to advise the other guards [your subordinates]
other younger men,
others, hm?
So that
they don't make any noise
So that they make none, hm?
So that they don't take anything that belongs to this place,
take nothing, hm?
because
All that is here
inside this city hall, hm?
belongs to the community
right and
The same [things] will be used
when the new administration comes
when they come, hm?
and on the same way they will need
they will need materials [to carry out]
they will need it all, hm? And
that is why we still call on you, hm?
So that
you don't make any noise, don't
[so that you don't] scream
Because as you know now, hm?
some of you
will be off duty for only one year,
will be off duty for only one year,
some of you
some of you
some of you
will be off duty for only one year,
Or
will be off duty for only two years,
you will fulfill a new role,
you will have new wisdom to
you will have new experiences to
you will have new things [to offer],
always, hm?
We will always return
We will always return
We will always return
We will always return
to this city hall, that's right
And that is why I hope that
We leave in good standing,
We leave in good terms
The best, hm? And
Because in some years, they do this hm?
they become so unpleasant as if they would never need to come back to this city hall
they become so unpleasant as if they would never have to come to city hall.
yes, they do
they sometimes scream,
they often mock their replacements
The incoming administration
they stand around to urinate [in]
they do;
they act foolish,
On the grass
anywhere, and
that's why I ask you not to act in this
that's why I ask you not to act in this
that's why I ask you not to act in this
That's why we still speak to you, hm?
in these humble few words to you
few words can be shared among us,
that's why when the time comes to
leave inconspicuously,
inconspicuously, okay
ideally, hm?
POT_gather relative you(pl subj)

once we are public servants, hm?
It is, hm?
that one
We do not know who started this tradition, hm?
We do not know who started this tradition, hm?
And that's why we called on you
if only to convey these few thoughts
hmmmm
And that's why we called on you
And that's why we called on you
if only to convey these few thoughts
if only to convey these few thoughts
hmmmm
So this man says

each one of us with all of you
As you now know
already you have obeyed

so that
we lend a hand to the mountains

(we) reached [that day today]
that day came today
you have fulfilled the task now
as we were saying
now that we have gone forth
time went by so quickly
[we have] completed, <<completed>> our month (lit. our moon)
[we have] completed <<completed>> our month (lit. our moon)
[you have]completed your day (lit. your star)
it came the hour [the time]
to leave

Let's not
let's not make fool ourselves
Let's not
as the new ones [new administration]
[the new ones] will enter, will arrive
the new ones] will enter, will arrive
[the new ones] will enter, will arrive
or
it would be bad (if someone were to makes fun of us)
it would be bad (if someone were to makes fun of us)
it would be bad (if someone were to makes fun of us)
they [can] sometimes
they [can] sometimes
they [can] sometimes
hang around [they behave this way]

they hang around doing foolish things to each other

outside they guys exist
they screaming at each other for no reason,

[they hang around] making fun of each other
Let us not say anything to them
Let us not say anything to them
Let us not say anything to them
Let us not say anything to them
Let us not say anything to them
Because as it is, or as things work
it is a job
it is a community
[this mandate] goes around,
rolls around
it stands
now we are leaving
a year from now
two years from now
another duty or position will come up
another duty or position will come up
another duty or position will come up
another duty or position will come up

even thought
it would be unfortunate if someone would made fun [of us]
it would be unfortunate if someone would made fun [of us]
it would be unfortunate if someone would made fun [of us]
it would be unfortunate if someone would made fun [of us]
We would feel bad if someone would
If they come and speak badly to us
because as things are
no one of us asked to be given a job
we are only fulfilling what it was ordered from us
any one of us who is fulfilling a post
It is just mandate
we are fulfilling what it was ordered from us, say
because this is our community
because it is the place where we sprouted
This is our birthplace
we will serve
that is why
and that is why
we thank you
for enduring,
tolerating the hardship
There were times when we had good things to say [to you]
There were times when we had good things to say [to you]
and there were times when you did not have anything good to say [to us]
we did not have anything good to say to [you]
we could not
speak better to you
we beg your forgiveness for all the [wrong things] we spoke
for all the things we could [not] be
for all
[may] God

We would been redeemed of our responsibility
yes indeed
As the mayor says
that
pay attention to all the ones that were helpers
pay attention to all the ones that were helpers
pay attention to all the ones that were helpers
because you were their bosses, hm?
so that you can tell them
to remain in town so that they can release them from their duties!
to remain in town so that they can release them from their duties!
to remain in town so that they can release them from their duties!
the new administration will be in charge of releasing you tomorrow
the new administration will be in charge of releasing you tomorrow
the new administration will be in charge of releasing you tomorrow
there was a day where
we spoke wrongly to you
we spoke frankly to you
but this is how authorities talk, so we say
always
it is heard in heaven,
on earth, hm?!
that the ones who are work,
the ones who are justice, hm?!
they talked frankly to them
the ones who are justice, hm?!
they talked frankly to them
so that
that the ones who are babies,
the ones who are young, learn
we speak to them as far as they are willing to listen
we speak to them as far as they are willing to listen
we speak to them as far as they are willing to listen
this is something good
we cannot say it is not bad thing, hm?!
we cannot say it is not bad thing, hm?!
god willing, we say
as anyone of them might feel
as anyone of them might feel
the ones who are the hands,
the ones who are the hands,
they ones who are the feet, hm?!
no one can predict
what kind of service awaits each one of us going forward
god is the one who decides and
even though
because you were their bosses
god is the one who decides what job each person will have
if god may be so generous, hm?!
if god may be so generous, hm?!
you may attain an important position
as ourselves, say
you may attain an important position
you may attain an important position
as ourselves, say
if god so ordains, we say
we cannot decide, we say
this is to be your new position, hm?!
this is to be your new position, hm?!
or
it is only god who decides what job each person will have

people are not working, this has to do with the way each person thinks
each person

Then they have to go if the corn has sprouted so that they can begin to take care of it.
And when the weeds are growing around the corn,
then they have to clean it so that the area where the corn plants are is very clean.
